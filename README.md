## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop a deep learning model that can predict the composer of a given musical score accurately. The project aims to accomplish this objective by using two deep learning techniques: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

The project will use a dataset consisting of musical scores from various composers. The dataset Download dataset will contain MIDI files and sheet music of compositions from well-known classical composers like Bach, Beethoven, Chopin, Mozart, Schubert, etc. The dataset should be labeled with the name of the composer for each score.
